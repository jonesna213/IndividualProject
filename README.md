# Navy Jones Individual Project

This repository will house my individual project for Enterprise Java.

### Problem Statement
For this project I wanted to recreate a project that I built in my Intro
to PHP w/MySQL class a few semesters ago (here it is on GitHub https://github.com/jonesna213/Auto-Parts-Project). 
The project is a honda civic auto parts shop where the user is able to create an account, view/search parts, 
add/remove parts to a cart, and checkout (not an actual payment process, just for show). This project
doesn't have any real purpose I just think it would be fun to create a most realistic ecommerce
website as I can since I have gained more knowledge than I had when I built it the first time.
Some addons I would like to add if I have time after doing the basics are things like saving items
to a favorites, check fitment (I believe there's api's that do this), some way to update the items
as in put new items in and update the prices based off what there being sold for.
