# Navy Jones Individual Project

This repository will house my individual project for Enterprise Java.

### Problem Statement
For this project I started wanting to recreate a project I built in my Intro to PHP w/MySQL class a few semesters
ago (here it is on GitHub https://github.com/jonesna213/Auto-Parts-Project), but I decided I wanted to change it up a bit. 
Instead of it being a shopping website I wanted to turn it into a parts look up site. Still for 6th gen Honda 
Civics, but a site similar to https://pcpartpicker.com where you can search for parts and then for each part 
it will show you different websites where they are being sold, so comparing prices and finding parts becomes 
easier. The big challenge for this project is going to be getting all the data from different websites and putting
it all together into my site. I think its do-able, but going to be difficult. In the site you will be able to
create and account, view/search for parts and save/un-save parts. For the searching for parts it will be you 
can search by name or part # also by category like brakes, exhaust, engine, etc. Some possible addons if time allows
would be to add like a save your vehicle feature where it only shows parts that fit your vehicle (even though
most 6th gen Civic parts are the same, some are slightly different. Trust me, ive ran into that problem before). 
My goal would be to get all the parts on the site, but I know that's not completely reasonable for the time frame.
So, my goal is to get as many as possible and keep expanding it even after class is over because as an owner of a
6th gen Civic this would be very helpful and some friends of mine would like it as well.
