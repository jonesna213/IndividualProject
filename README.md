# Navy Jones Individual Project

This repository will house my individual project for Enterprise Java.

### Problem Statement
For this project I wanted to recreate a project that I built in my Intro
to PHP w/MySQL class a few semesters ago (here it is on GitHub https://github.com/jonesna213/Auto-Parts-Project). 
The project is a honda civic auto parts shop where the user is able to create an account, view/search parts, 
add/remove parts to a cart, and checkout (not an actual payment process, just for show).
