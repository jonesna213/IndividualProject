researching, not much code was written sadly)

10/13/2022 - 5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Completed getting hibernate working with database for all the relationships
 * Completed all dao tests (There was a problem with the equals method, so I had to redo a lot of the tests because for

### Week 8

10/18/2022 - 1 hour

Tasks Completed:
 * Got view/edit profile working (Just going to update database for now)
 * implemented JQuery Form validation

10/19/2022 - 1.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Got hibernate working correctly and updated tests to account for it. Thought it was correct before but when a user 
was deleted it deleted the part that was with the user in the saved parts table. Did the same thing with merchants and 
parts. But its working correctly now.

 * Configured aws to allow cognito logins
 * Configured aws database to have current database
 * Submitted checkpoint 3
 * Got view parts jsp looking good on mobile
 * Got saved parts jsp working
 * Realized I made a big mistake.... The parts image file location is saved as rock auto's website... not where it's
located in the project. Merchant logo image is saved correctly but doesn't show up...
 * Fixed images problem after some debugging I just decided to put them in the webapp dir

### Week 10

This week was not as productive as the last few weeks. I've been working on the team project as well as other classes,
so I wasn't able to do much for this project this week. I did do the recommendations from checkpoint 3, and I did 
start doing some research on how to implement google's recaptcha. I'm thinking since I cant directly change the UI of 
cognito im going to have it go to a recaptcha page before it goes to auth then if they pass the recaptcha it will then 
go to auth and continue signing in. I am going to look into this a little more to see if there's an easier/nicer way to 
do this because I feel like this might cause some problems with cognito.

### Week 11

This was another not so productive week...

11/11/2022 - 4 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Made a bit of progress on the OReilly web scraping
 * Did research on recaptcha with cognito and didn't find anything that would help... Might have to find a different api.


### Week 12

11/18/2022 - 2 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Got OReilly working for the brake pads which gives a duplicate part which demonstrates everything works.
 * Fixed ImageDownloader

### Week 13

11/25/2022 - 1 hour

Tasks Completed:
 * Touched up a few things
 * Changed up web scraping directory

11/26/2022 - 3 hours

### Week 14

11/28/2022 - 1 hour

Tasks Completed:
 * Went through current code and made sure I had all java doc and comments were necessary
 * Refactored some code


### Week 15

12/7/2022 - 1.5 hours 513

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose to use a weather api to display the weather in the header. I couldn't find an api that would make sense with
the rest of the project/add to the rest of the project, so I just decided that I should at least have some type of api.
 * Got weather dao set up as well as the api's java classes.
 * Changed the database and related to have a zip column for the api.
