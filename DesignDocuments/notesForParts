Each part has a unique part number. The part number is from the brand. EX (wagner break pads part# OEX465A, Part number
is the same on every site for that same part with the brand)

For rock auto, gotta incorporate something for the "add to cart to see price". maybe something like a script that will
modify it then select the price from the cart. OR just say add to car to see price then they can do the rest.

For images, Im thinking to check if the database has an image for it already and if so discard the image otherwise add
it to the db. (Only going to have one image for each part, may try to add more in the future, but seems really daunting
atm so im going to go with 1)


For scraping, each site will need its own class since there all designed differently (Goal is to have at least 2 by end of class).
Maybe have an interface behind them? Atm im thinking to where they have a driver class that will execute them. might
add admin functionality in the future for doing it on the site.
